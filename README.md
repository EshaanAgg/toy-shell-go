This is my Go solution to the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) by Codecrafters, born out of the realization that [Rust is too diffcult for me](https://github.com/EshaanAgg/toy-shell) to sanely code in.  

This is a simple Unix shell built from scratch, which supports:
- Basic commands like `echo`, `type`, `exit`
- Parsing of the `PATH` environment variable to find exectuables to run
- Navigation of the file system with `pwd` and `cd`, along with parsing of the `HOME` environment variable
